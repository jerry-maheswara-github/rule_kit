//! # rule_kit
//!
//! **A blazing-fast, composable, and DSL-friendly rule engine kit for Rust.**
//!
//! > Define your rules. Plug your context. Let the engine do the rest.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## ✨ Features
//!
//! - Minimal core: no assumptions, no boilerplate
//! - Pluggable rules: implement `Rule<T>` for any context
//! - DSL-friendly: support JSON/YAML/Struct-based rules
//! - Built for scale: evaluate hundreds of rules with ease
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 🚀 Quick Start
//!
//! Define a context (e.g. a struct), implement `Rule<T>`, and plug it into `RuleEngine`:
//!
//! ```rust
//!  use rule_kit::{Rule, RuleEngine};
//!
//!  #[derive(Debug)]
//!  struct Order {
//!     pub total: f64,
//!  }
//!
//!  #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
//!  enum OrderRule {
//!     DiscountIfHighValue,
//!  }
//!
//!  impl Rule<Order> for OrderRule {
//!     type Output = f64;
//!     type RuleError = ();
//!
//!     fn evaluate(&self, ctx: &Order) -> Result<bool, Self::RuleError> {
//!         match self {
//!             OrderRule::DiscountIfHighValue => Ok(ctx.total > 100.0),
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     fn apply(&self, ctx: &Order) -> Result<Self::Output, Self::RuleError> {
//!         match self {
//!             OrderRule::DiscountIfHighValue => Ok(ctx.total * 0.10), // 10% discount
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     fn priority(&self) -> u32 {
//!         1
//!     }
//! }
//!
//!  let order = Order { total: 150.0 };
//!  let rules = vec![OrderRule::DiscountIfHighValue];
//!  let engine = RuleEngine::new(rules.clone(), None);
//!
//!  let result = engine.evaluate_all(&order).unwrap();
//!  println!("Adjustments: {:?}", result);
//!
//! // - Using RuleEngineBuilder for more flexibility
//!  use rule_kit::builder::RuleEngineBuilder;
//!  use rule_kit::utils::PriorityOrder;
//!  let engine_built = RuleEngineBuilder::new()
//!     .with_rules(rules)
//!     .priority_asc()
//!     .build();
//!
//!  println!("Adjustments: {:?}", engine_built.evaluate_all(&order).unwrap());
//! ```
//! ---
//!
//! ## 📦 Design Philosophy
//!
//! `rule_kit` is designed to be:
//!
//! - **Composable** — add your own rule logic without modifying the engine
//! - **Extensible** — supports rule metadata, DSL parsing, logging, etc.
//! - **Performant** — built with scaling in mind (Rayon-friendly)
//!
//! You implement the `Rule<T>` trait for your domain, and the engine handles
//! prioritization, condition evaluation, and output aggregation.

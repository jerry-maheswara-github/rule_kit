/// A generic trait that defines a rule which can be evaluated and applied
/// based on a given context `C`.
///
/// This trait is useful in rule-based systems, decision engines, or business logic
/// where individual rules must determine whether they apply and, if so, produce a result.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `C` - The context type used for evaluating and applying the rule.
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// * `Output` - The type returned by the [`Rule::apply`] method when the rule is successfully applied.
/// * `RuleError` - The error type returned by [`Rule::evaluate`] or [`Rule::apply`] if something goes wrong.
pub trait Rule<C> {
    /// The output type produced by this rule when successfully applied.
    type Output;

    /// The error type that may be returned during evaluation or application.
    type RuleError;

    /// Evaluates whether this rule is applicable to the given context.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `ctx` - A reference to the context used for evaluation.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(true)` if the rule applies.
    /// * `Ok(false)` if the rule does not apply.
    /// * `Err(RuleError)` if an error occurs during evaluation.

    /// This method assumes that [`Rule::evaluate`] has returned `Ok(true)`.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `ctx` - A reference to the context used for application.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(Output)` if the rule is successfully applied.
    /// * `Err(RuleError)` if an error occurs during application.

    /// Returns the priority of this rule.
    ///
    /// This value can be used to determine the order in which multiple rules are
    /// evaluated or applied. Higher values indicate higher priority.
    /// By default, the priority is `0`.

    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A `u32` representing the rule's priority.
